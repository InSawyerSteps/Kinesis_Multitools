# Diagnostic Summary: Windsurf Tool Malfunctions (MCP Server Project)

## Context

This document summarizes issues encountered with tools provided to the Cascade AI assistant within the Windsurf environment while working on the `MCP Server` project (`c:\Projects\MCP Server`). These tools are believed to be powered by the MCP server defined in `c:\Projects\MCP Server\src\toolz.py`.

## Observed Problems

1.  **`view_file` Tool Failure:**
    *   **Observation:** When attempting to use the `view_file` tool on various files within the `c:\Projects\MCP Server` workspace (including `.py` and `.html` files), the tool consistently returns only the *first line* of the file content.
    *   **Files Tested (all failed):**
        *   `c:\Projects\MCP Server\rag_recruiting_mvp\mcp_client.py`
        *   `c:\Projects\MCP Server\rag_recruiting_mvp\main_app.py`
        *   `c:\Projects\MCP Server\rag_recruiting_mvp\rag_mcp_server.py`
        *   `c:\Projects\MCP Server\rag_recruiting_mvp\templates\index.html`
        *   `c:\Projects\MCP Server\src\toolz.py`
    *   **Impact:** Prevents the AI assistant from reliably inspecting code or file content. A PC restart did not resolve this.

2.  **`mcp0_get_server_info` Tool Failure:**
    *   **Observation:** When attempting to use the `mcp0_get_server_info` tool (also provided by the same `local_project_server`), it failed execution.
    *   **Error Message:** `Encountered error in step execution: error executing cascade step: CORTEX_STEP_TYPE_MCP_TOOL: Error executing tool get_server_info: 'FastMCP' object has no attribute 'version'`
    *   **Impact:** Indicates a more fundamental issue than just file reading. Prevents retrieval of basic server information.

## Diagnosis

*   The consistent failure of `view_file` across different file types suggests the problem is not specific to file parsing (e.g., Python vs. HTML).
*   The specific error `'FastMCP' object has no attribute 'version'` when running `mcp0_get_server_info` strongly points to an **internal code or configuration issue within the `src/toolz.py` script itself**.
*   Possible causes within `src/toolz.py`:
    *   Incorrect initialization of the `FastMCP` server object (missing a `version` attribute).
    *   Use of an incompatible version of the `FastMCP` library or related dependencies.
    *   A typo or logical error within the `mcp0_get_server_info` tool's function definition attempting to access `mcp.version`.

## Conclusion

The tool malfunctions appear to stem from an underlying issue within the `src/toolz.py` MCP server definition file. This prevents the AI assistant from effectively using tools like `view_file` to inspect the project codebase. Resolving the `'FastMCP' object has no attribute 'version'` error within `src/toolz.py` is likely necessary to restore tool functionality.

## Note on RAG Application Error

These tool issues are separate from the "No valid JSON output from MCP subprocess" error observed *within* the RAG Recruiting application (`rag_recruiting_mvp/main_app.py`). That error relates to internal communication problems within the RAG app itself.
