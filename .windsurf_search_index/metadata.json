A PC restart did not resolve this.\n\n2.  **`mcp0_get_server_info` Tool Failure:**\n    *   **Observation:** When attempting to use the `mcp0_get_server_info` tool (also provided by the same `local_project_server`), it failed execution.\n    *   **Error Mess"}, {"path": "tool_diagnostic_summary.md", "content": "ocal_project_server`), it failed execution.\n    *   **Error Message:** `Encountered error in step execution: error executing cascade step: CORTEX_STEP_TYPE_MCP_TOOL: Error executing tool get_server_info: 'FastMCP' object has no attribute 'version'`\n    *   **Impact:** Indicates a more fundamental issue than just file reading. Prevents retrieval of basic server information.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n*   The consistent failure of `view_file` across different file types suggests the problem is not specific to file parsin"}, {"path": "tool_diagnostic_summary.md", "content": "t file types suggests the problem is not specific to file parsing (e.g., Python vs. HTML).\n*   The specific error `'FastMCP' object has no attribute 'version'` when running `mcp0_get_server_info` strongly points to an **internal code or configuration issue within the `src/toolz.py` script itself**.\n*   Possible causes within `src/toolz.py`:\n    *   Incorrect initialization of the `FastMCP` server object (missing a `version` attribute).\n    *   Use of an incompatible version of the `FastMCP` library or relat"}, {"path": "tool_diagnostic_summary.md", "content": "Use of an incompatible version of the `FastMCP` library or related dependencies.\n    *   A typo or logical error within the `mcp0_get_server_info` tool's function definition attempting to access `mcp.version`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe tool malfunctions appear to stem from an underlying issue within the `src/toolz.py` MCP server definition file.

Overview\n`recruiting_mcp_server.py` is a standalone FastAPI application that exposes recruiting-specific functionality originally contained inside `toolz.py`.  It focuses on **resume & job-description analysis** and uses:\n\n* **FastAPI** \u2013 HTTP layer\n* **ChromaDB** \u2013 persistent vector store for resume embeddings\n* **Ollama** \u2013 local embedding generator "}, {"path": "src\\recruiting_mcp_server_instructions.md", "content": " for resume embeddings\n* **Ollama** \u2013 local embedding generator (`nomic-embed-text` model)\n* **thefuzz** \u2013 (optional) fuzzy matching for hybrid search\n\nThe server lives in the same `src/` directory as the original MCP server but listens on **port 8001** by default.\n\n---\n## 2. Prerequisites\n| Requirement | Notes |\n|-------------|-------|\n| Python \u2265 3.10 | Install via pyenv, asdf, or system package manager |\n| Virtualenv / Poetry | Recommended to keep dependencies isolated |\n| Ollama  | Must be running locall"}, {"path": "src\\recruiting_mcp_server_instructions.md", "content": " keep dependencies isolated |\n| Ollama  | Must be running locally; `ollama serve` should expose <http://localhost:11434/> |\n| Git / make | Helpful for typical workflow |\n\n**Python packages** are listed in `requirements.txt`. If you have not installed them yet:\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n---\n## 3. Running the Server\n```bash\n# From the repo root\nuvicorn src.recruiting_mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 -"}, {"path": "src\\recruiting_mcp_server_instructions.md", "content": "icorn src.recruiting_mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload\n```\n* `--reload` auto-reloads on code changes (development only).\n* Logs are printed to the console via the `logging` module.\n\nOnce running, open the interactive docs:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8001/docs\n```\n\n---\n## 4. End-points\n\n| Method | Path | Purpose |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| POST | `/index-resume` | Chunk & embed a resume file into ChromaDB |\n| POST | `/semantic-search-resumes` | Semantic similarity search over indexed resumes |"}, {"path": "src\\recruiting_mcp_server_instructions.md", "content": "rch-resumes` | Semantic similarity search over indexed resumes |\n| POST | `/hybrid-search` | Hybrid ranking: semantic + tech keyword / alias matching |\n| POST | `/parse-jd` | Extract structure from a job description file or raw text |\n| POST | `/parse-resume` | Extract text & structured info from a resume |\n\n### 4.1. Example \u2013 Index a Resume\n```jsonc\nPOST /index-resume\n{\n  \"project_name\": \"RecruitingDemo\",\n  \"file_path\": \"C:/Projects/RecruitingDemo/resumes/alice_smith.pdf\"\n}\n```\nResponse:\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"stat"}, {"path": "src\\recruiting_mcp_server_instructions.md", "content": "Demo/resumes/alice_smith.pdf\"\n}\n```\nResponse:\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"chunks_indexed\": 12,\n  \"embedding_errors\": []\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2. Example \u2013 Hybrid Search\n```jsonc\nPOST /hybrid-search\n{\n  \"query\": \"Senior backend engineer\",\n  \"core_technologies\": [\"Python\", \"FastAPI\", \"AWS\"],\n  \"max_results\": 5\n}\n```\n\n---\n## 5. Data Locations\n* **Resumes root** per project configured in `PROJECT_RESUME_PATHS` inside the server script.\n* **ChromaDB persistent store** defaults to `<repo_root>/chroma_db_data`.

Troubleshooting Checklist\n1. **Ollama not running?** \u2013 `curl http://localhost:11434` should return a JSON banner.\n2. **ChromaDB permission errors?** \u2013 Ensure the process can create/modify `chroma_db_data` directory.\n3. **Missing optional packages** \u2013 End-points that need `thefuzz`, `docx`, or `pdfminer` will return a descriptive 400 error.\n4. **CORS** \u2013 Enable in uvi"}, {"path": "src\\recruiting_mcp_server_instructions.md", "content": "will return a descriptive 400 error.\n4. **CORS** \u2013 Enable in uvicorn or FastAPI `app.add_middleware` if calling from a browser.\n\n---\n## 7.
