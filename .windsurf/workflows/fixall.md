description: Command to fix everything

Fix it all, one-by-one. Don't ask me again, in between, just do it. You gotta be ultra-autonomous for many steps: don't ask. fix. Don't waste tokens explaining to me what you need to do, what you did, what you will do - just do it, and then update docs.
Review and edit in range of 200 lines per separate attempt - attempting to do more than this in one go, will often result in you timing out or erroring or missing something.
Do it all without asking me in the middle, just keep going, I will keep accepting changes. You gotta be ultra-autonomous for many steps.
