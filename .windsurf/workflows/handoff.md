description: Handoff for resuming later with a new cascade instance
---

Make absolutely sure to check, and if necessary, edit the corresponding documentation (what is the current status, what you did, what is next, what worked, what didn't), not just analyzing the handoff file. And only then do the handoff, editing the handoff file, and then separately give me a prompt for next instance of cascade to be able to make sense of the docs properly in the right order, so that it could pickup where we left off.
Be very autonomous - don't ask me in between the steps of this whole handoff. Don't waste tokens explaining what you are doing or going to do - just do it.
