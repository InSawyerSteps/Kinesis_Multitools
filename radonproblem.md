# Radon Integration Problem Report (2025-07-01)

## Executive Summary

The MCP Server's static analysis tool integration is blocked by a persistent Radon import error. Despite Radon 6.0.1 being installed in the virtual environment, the server cannot import `radon.cli.config`, preventing cyclomatic complexity analysis from functioning. This document details the issue, all attempted fixes, code changes, and the most recent debug output, and provides a technical diagnosis and next steps.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

- **Goal:** Enable Radon-based cyclomatic complexity analysis in the MCP Server via the `analyze` tool.
- **Blocker:** The server fails to import `radon.cli.config` at runtime, resulting in complexity analysis always returning "radon not installed".

---

## 2. What We Tried

### a. Environment and Dependency Checks
- Verified that the project uses a dedicated virtual environment: `.venv`.
- Ran `pip freeze` inside `.venv` to confirm Radon 6.0.1 is installed:
  - `radon==6.0.1` appears in both `pip freeze` and `requirements.txt`.
- Checked that all other static analysis dependencies (pylint, bandit, vulture, libcst, etc.) are present and up to date.

### b. Debug Code and Diagnostics
- Added extensive debug output to `src/toolz.py` to print:
  - Python executable, version, and virtual environment status
  - `sys.path`
  - All loaded modules and their file paths
  - Results of `pkgutil.iter_modules()` for Radon
  - Step-by-step Radon import attempts, with detailed error logging and fallback diagnostics
- Ensured all debug and Radon import blocks are lint- and syntax-error free.

### c. Code Edits
- Refactored the debug import logic for Radon:
  - Moved all logic into a robust nested `try`/`except` block
  - Ensured that any import or module discovery errors are caught and logged
  - Ensured that `RADON_AVAILABLE`, `CCHarvester`, and `Config` are always set safely
- Cleaned up docstring and comment formatting to remove all syntax and lint errors in the debug section.

### d. Testing
- Ran the MCP server with `fastmcp run src/toolz.py ...` and observed debug output
- Ran the test client to call the `analyze` tool with `complexity` analysis
- Confirmed that the server starts and responds, but always reports Radon as unavailable

## 3. Most Recent Debug Output

---

## 4. Technical Diagnosis

- **Radon 6.0.1 is present and importable** at the top level.
- **The `radon/cli` submodule is missing** entirely from the installed package:
  - Only `complexity.py`, `metrics.py`, `raw.py`, and `visitors.py` are present in `radon`.
  - `radon/cli/config.py` and `radon/cli/harvest.py` (required for complexity analysis) are absent.
- **This is not normal for a proper Radon 6.x install.**
- **Root cause is almost certainly a corrupted or partial Radon installation**:
  - Could be due to a bad wheel, interrupted install, or a conflict with another Radon install on the Python path.

---

## 5. What Was Edited

- `src/toolz.py`:
  - All debug and Radon import logic refactored for robust error handling and maximum diagnostic output
  - All syntax and lint errors in the debug block fixed
  - No changes to core logic outside debug and import handling
- `requirements.txt`:
  - Reviewed and confirmed correct, no changes made

---

## 6. Next Steps / Recommended Fix

1. **Force a clean reinstall of Radon 6.0.1:**
   - Uninstall all Radon versions:
     ```
     pip uninstall -y radon
     ```
   - Reinstall Radon 6.0.1 (not editable, not from cache):
     ```
     pip install --no-cache-dir radon==6.0.1
     ```
   - Verify that `.venv/Lib/site-packages/radon/cli/config.py` exists.
2. **Restart the MCP server and retest.**
3. If the problem persists, check for shadowed or conflicting Radon installations elsewhere on `sys.path`.

---

## 7. Additional Notes

- All other MCP tools and dependencies are present and functional.
- The problem is isolated to the Radon installation in the virtual environment.
- If a full reinstall does not fix the issue, consider removing and recreating the entire virtual environment.
